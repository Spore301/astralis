## Design Notes

This project uses a "mobile-first" approach but scales up to a full cinematic experience on desktop. The design system is defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css`.

> **Note**: This project was initialized in a directory structure that may contain spaces in parent folders (`Astrology /`). Ensure paths are quoted if navigating from the root.
